# Student-Reporter

# Objective:
Preparing report cards for number of students involves same task need to be performed every time. As this work involves doing calculation on same rules to make final results for each result and writing it manually on report card using pen and paper. So, to eliminate such type of work, it’s better to achieve this work using computer system. Teachers or 
persons who will responsible for preparing report card have to enter only marks of each subject for every student and processing work will take care by the computer system in order to prepare final report card. Even system will relieve teachers for writing manually on report card and providing print facility by which, it will enable them to display the marks of each student on paper by just one click. As system has been provided with all maximum possibility to make their task easier, so number of features has been made available to continue the task without any intervention. It will only not prepare the report card, but also able to store data of each student, so that it can be accessed any time and if required can make modification as per requirement. The concept of graphics has been used which will make its user to use this system in an easy manner.

# Proposed System:
This system has been developed to eliminate the repetitive tasks which is to be performed manually thus saving time and investment. This new system will store all the student records along with their marks and report card details, by which teachers and admin will able to retrieve these records whenever they required. It will enable teachers to get information on various sections such as list of failures students, list of toppers students, students list who have failed in particular subject etc using the predefined rules set by the institutions. Apart from these searching and sorting mechanism has been used to make these tasks faster. It will enable teachers to make report card, by entering subject marks, viewing report card of all or particular student, easy navigation system from moving one module to next module while using this system.

# The basic features of the student report management system are as follows:
